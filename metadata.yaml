description: Raised by a superficial single mother, young Linda leads an isolated
  life of endless travel, and then is given to a wealthy man in a marriage of convenience.
  Her struggles with marriage and her family convince Linda that she is emotionless.
  Written in the author's signature aesthetic" style, this 1919 novel is a bleakly
  naturalistic portrait of a soul unable to connect with others.
